# Protecting-User-Password-Keys-at-Rest
This project focuses on developing a system to protect user password keys stored at rest (on the disk). The aim is to ensure that even if an attacker gains physical or remote access to the disk, they cannot retrieve the password keys.


Overview
This project focuses on developing a system to protect user password keys stored at rest (on the disk). The aim is to ensure that even if an attacker gains physical or remote access to the disk, they cannot retrieve the password keys. The system will use a combination of encryption, key management, and access control mechanisms to secure the password keys.

Components
Encryption

Use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting the password keys.
Implement secure key storage using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a trusted execution environment (TEE).
Key Management

Implement a secure key management system to handle the generation, storage, and rotation of encryption keys.
Use asymmetric encryption (RSA) to protect the symmetric keys.
Access Control

Implement strict access control policies to limit who can access the encryption keys.
Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing the key management system.
Auditing and Logging

Implement logging for all key management operations.
Set up alerts for any suspicious activities.

Unique Idea Brief
The unique idea behind this project is to implement a multi-layered security approach to protect user password keys at rest. This includes encrypting the keys with a strong symmetric encryption algorithm (AES), securely managing the encryption keys using asymmetric encryption (RSA), enforcing strict access controls with multi-factor authentication (MFA), and maintaining comprehensive logging for audit purposes. By integrating these components, the system provides robust security for password keys stored on the disk.

Features Offered
Strong Encryption: Uses AES for encrypting password keys to ensure confidentiality.
Secure Key Management: Handles key generation, storage, and rotation using RSA encryption.
Access Control: Enforces strict access policies with multi-factor authentication.
Auditing and Logging: Maintains logs for all key management operations and alerts for suspicious activities.
Scalability: The system is designed to be scalable and can be integrated into larger security infrastructures.
Process Flow
Key Generation: Generate a strong AES key using PBKDF2HMAC and store it securely.
Password Encryption: Encrypt user password keys using the AES key and store the encrypted passwords.
Password Decryption: Decrypt the stored encrypted passwords when needed using the AES key.
Key Management: Generate RSA key pairs, encrypt the AES key with the RSA public key, and securely store the encrypted AES key.
Access Control: Implement multi-factor authentication to control access to the key management system.
Auditing and Logging: Log all key management operations and monitor for suspicious activities.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to protecting user password keys at rest. It combines encryption, key management, access control, and logging to ensure that password keys remain secure even if the disk is compromised. Each component is implemented using robust cryptographic practices, and the overall system can be customized further based on specific requirements and threat models.

For a more extensive and production-ready system, consider integrating with hardware security modules (HSMs), implementing additional access controls, and performing regular security audits.
